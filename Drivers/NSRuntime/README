This directory contains the source code of the Einstein NS Runtime package
which is eventually included into Einstein.rex.

This package contains NewtonScript code in the rex specific to Einstein.

For convenience, Einstein NS Runtime.pkg binary is included.

The package can be compiled using Newton Toolkit (Mac version).

For this purpose:
1. Creator codes and file types of text files should be fixed with the following
command (on MacOS X)

SetFile -c NTP1 -t TEXT "Display Params.f" \
    "Handlers.f" "Install & Remove.f" "Native Global FUnctions.f" \
    "NIE Bindings.f" "UserInfo.f"

2. Creator codes and file type of "NS Runtime.ntkc" should be fixed with the
following command:

SetFile -c NTP1 -t ntkc "Native Module/NSRuntime.ntkc"

NS Runtime.ntkc is provided for convenience, but could be rebuilt from source
code.

3. Files with resource forks should be decoded from MacBinary with:

macbinary decode "Einstein NS Runtime.bin"
macbinary decode "package.rsrc.bin"
macbinary decode "Main Layout.bin"
