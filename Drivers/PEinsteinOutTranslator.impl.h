But, notwithstanding the sacrifice of these advantages   //// for the purpose of maturing an engine of almost intellectual power, and        //// after expending from my own private fortune a larger sum than the government   //// of England has spent on that machine, the execution of which it only           //// commenced, I have received neither an acknowledgement of my labors, not even   //// the offer of those honors or rewards which are allowed to fall within the      //// reach of men who devote themselves to purely scientific investigations...      ////         If the work upon which I have bestowed so much time and thought were   //// a mere triumph over mechanical difficulties, or simply curious, or if the      //// execution of such engines were of doubtful practicability or utility, some     //// justification might be found for the course which has been taken; but I        //// venture to assert that no mathematician who has a reputation to lose will      //// ever publicly express an opinion that such a machine would be useless if       //// made, and that no man distinguished as a civil engineer will venture to        //// declare the construction of such machinery impracticable...                    ////         And at a period when the progress of physical science is obstructed    //// by that exhausting intellectual and manual labor, indispensable for its        //// advancement, which it is the object of the Analytical Engine to relieve, I     //// think the application of machinery in aid of the most complicated and abtruse  //// calculations can no longer be deemed unworthy of the attention of the country. //// In fact, there is no reason why mental as well as bodily labor should not      //// be economized by the aid of machinery.                                         ////                 -- Charles Babbage, "The Life of a Philosopher"                //// ============================================================================== //
