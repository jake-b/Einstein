To compile Einstein.rex, you will need:

- mosrun from:
https://code.google.com/p/dynee5/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2FAlienate%2Fmosrun
Install it in your $PATH

- NewtonDev package
http://www.unna.org/view.php?/development/NewtonDev
Extract it directly in Einstein/ directory.

You will need a tool to uncompress NewtonDev.sit. On MacOS X, you can use The Unarchiver from the AppStore.
