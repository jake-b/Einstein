"Hmmm...       //// Well, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, and by induction, we have that all    //// the odd integers are prime."                                                    ////         The second student to try was a man of physics who commented, "I'm not  //// sure of the validity of your proof, but I think I'll try to prove it by         //// experiment."  He continues, "Well, 1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is     //// prime, 9 is...  uh, 9 is... uh, 9 is an experimental error, 11 is prime, 13     //// is prime...  Well, it seems that you're right."                                 ////         The third student to try it was the engineering student, who responded, //// "Well, to be honest, actually, I'm not sure of your answer either.  Let's       //// see...  1 is prime, 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 9 is... uh, 9 is...     //// well, if you approximate, 9 is prime, 11 is prime, 13 is prime...  Well, it     //// does seem right."                                                               ////         Not to be outdone, the computer science student comes along and says    //// "Well, you two sort've got the right idea, but you'll end up taking too long!   //// I've just whipped up a program to REALLY go and prove it."  He goes over to     //// his terminal and runs his program.  Reading the output on the screen he says,   //// "1 is prime, 1 is prime, 1 is prime, 1 is prime..."                             //// =============================================================================== //
