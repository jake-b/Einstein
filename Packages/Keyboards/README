This directory contains the source code of the Keyboard package which is
eventually included into Einstein.rex.

For convenience, Keyboards.pkg binary is included.

The package can be compiled using Newton Toolkit (Mac version).

For this purpose:
1. Creator codes and file types of text files "Install & Remove.f"
"KeyboardsDefinitions.f" should be fixed with the following command (on MacOS X)

SetFile -c NTP1 -t TEXT Install\ \&\ Remove.f KeyboardsDefinitions.f

2. Keyboards and Keyboards.rsrc shall be decoded from MacBinary, for example
with:

macbinary decode Keyboards.bin
macbinary decode Keyboards.rsrc.bin
